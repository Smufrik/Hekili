# Hekili (MoP Classic) v5.5.1-1.0.0m — 2025-10-27

Highlights

- Death Knight (Frost/Blood)
  - Empower Rune Weapon: stricter gating to avoid early use.
    - Frost: require no Frost+Death runes with sufficient RP deficit; relaxed in Pillar windows.
    - Blood: require no FU pair (and insufficient death runes to substitute) with high RP deficit; relaxed during Vampiric Blood.
  - Death rune counting: switched to live API checks to fix runes.death.count usage across APL conditions.
  - Blood APL fixes:
    - Use Rune Strike as the RP spender (replaces Death Coil in DPS and AoE lists).
    - Plague Leech only when both diseases are ticking and either low remains (<=3s) or rune_deficit >= 2.
- Shaman (Enhancement)
  - Mechanics: added swing-weave hardcasting improvements.
