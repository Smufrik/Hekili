I will switch status after receiving confirmation from the respective thread.

For installation simply download the latest Version from 
my own repo and unzip and rename the molder inside and move it into your Addons Folder and rename to Hekili: https://github.com/Smufrik/hekili-mop
Some Specs have newer rotations/luas available before they are added to the release - check the corresponding thread (follow the link behind the class) if there is an alternative version available.
