# Hekili

**Hekili** is a powerful, highly configurable **rotation/priority helper** for **World of Warcraft**. It supports **all DPS and Tank specializations**. Healer specializations are supported with a focus on **DPS abilities**, great for solo content or downtime during PvE.

## ‚ú® What Does It Do?

Hekili displays a **sequential queue of icons** showing which abilities to use next ‚Äî helping you make fast, informed decisions in combat. It supports **1 to 10 icons** at a time (default is 3), each one representing the **next best action**.

The logic behind these decisions comes from **SimulationCraft Action Priority Lists (APLs)**, known to many as the tool [RaidBots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot). These are translated into addon logic as closely as possible and are **regularly updated** to reflect class balance changes and theorycrafting.

It‚Äôs a helpful tool for:

- Increasing your **damage output**
- Learning unfamiliar specializations
- Gaining new insights into specs you already play

---

## üîß How Does It Work?

Hekili uses your current character state (cooldowns, resources, buffs/debuffs, enemies nearby, etc.) to **simulate several spells into the future**, assuming you follow its recommendations.

As soon as you press a spell ‚Äî even one that wasn‚Äôt the current recommendation ‚Äî the addon will **instantly re-evaluate** and show updated suggestions.

This makes Hekili incredibly responsive and helpful for both casual and competitive players.

Other features include:
- Optional Separate Displays for:
  - AoE-specific rotation
  - Cooldowns
  - Defensive abilities
  - Interrupts
    - The addon can recommend interrupts on your primary target, guiding you to interrupt as late into the cast as possible
    - A season mythic+ filter can be enabled to only recommend interrupting important spells
- Toggle controls for cooldowns, defensives, and more:
  - These keybindable and macroable toggles allow you to enable or disable the use of major abilities like **2-minute cooldowns**, giving you direct control over when they are used.
  - This is a powerful feature of the addon: pairing your cooldown usage with encounter knowledge can lead to **significant DPS gains**.
  - Instead of toggling on and off, these abilities can also be shown in a separate, dedicated**Cooldowns display**, letting you manually choose when to cast them.
- Compatible with **ElvUI**, **Bartender**, and other UI mods
- Highly customizable:
  - Enable or disable different displays (Automatic, AOE, Single Target, Dual-Display, Dual-Reactive Display)
  - Change icon layout, spacing, fonts, and sizing
  - Adjust visibility settings by content (PvE, PvP, mounted, etc.)
  - Even the rotation is customizble if you desire, using (mostly) SimulationCraft syntax and expressions
